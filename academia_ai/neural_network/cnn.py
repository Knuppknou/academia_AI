class ConvolutionalNeuralNet(object):
    """Convolutional neural network holds layers and methods to train and test.

    It is built from  several neural layers, as for example convolutional
    layers, pooling layers or fully connected layers.

    Usage:
    1. Create the layers that will be used in the network and create an empty
       ConvolutionalNeuralNet.
    2. Add all layers using the add_layer() method in the order they should be
       placed in the net.
    3. Use the network's forward_prop() to iterate a given input array through
       the entire network.
    4. Do back_prop() and check if the network improved.
    5. Repeat 3-4 as often as one can afford.

    Example:
    -> See ipython notebooks for demonstrations.


    Notes / To Do:
    - One should alternate forward_prop and back_prop, because each call to
      forward_prop saves data necessary for back_prop.
      (...Should handle this for the user)
    - Should include some mechanism to avoid overfitting.
    - Should keep track of all input and output dimensions. Should build the
      right dimensions for the user from simple arguments. It should be
      impossible to connect layers that have incompatible dimensions.
    - Tuning the learning_rate is crucial. Should provide functions to help.
    - The save and load using pickling is pretty bad, as changes to the source
      code quickly render saved files useless.
 
    Implementation details:
    Each layer must provide methods forward_prop and back_prop to move
    through the network layers.

    Each single layer forward_prop method takes data as input in the form of a
    three-dimensional numpy array data[depth][x][y] and return the propagated
    data which is also three-dimensional but all individual dimensions might
    change. The last layer of the network consist of output classes and during
    training, the output of the last layer is compared to the solution using
    an error function.

    Backpropagation of each single layer, back_prop, consists of two steps:
    1. From the input dError/dOutput calculate dError/dInput to pass it to
       the previous layer in backpropagation.
    2. In case of variable weights, calculate dError/dWeights to adjust
       the weights in the direction of decreasing error.
